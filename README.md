##Overview
Exploring particle gameplay with music responsiveness

##Motivation
This is my first foray into Web Audio and Canvas. I'm just learning the ropes of these API right now.

##Usage
Listen to your favorite soundtrack and watch the particles interact with the music. If you want to interact, too, click your mouse on the screen and manipulate the particles.
